This is the only possible time for doing that.
I met him once.
When did you see him?
I had hoped to meet you there.
That is his house.
I must go some day or other.
The rumor turned out to be false.
Tell me about it.
I don't quite understand what he says.
It was very nice seeing you again.
It sounds pretty good.
What are you getting at?
I am quite in the dark as to what she is going to do.
She left home just now.
He is particularly kind to her.
Do it quickly.
She felt as if she had seen a ghost.
I'd rather you stayed at home.
I found the book easy.
There's something I need to talk with you about.
Something is the matter with him today.
I managed to make him understand it.
That is her house.
He went home with a heavy heart.
I don't want to go alone.
What I want to say is this.
Those are our books.
Where is it possible for you to see me?
Get to the point!
I'm glad to meet you, too.
You should have nothing to complain about.
Don't look at her enviously.
Let me have a try at it.
It is me that is wrong.
I'm at a loss for what to say.
He told her and she smiled.
This is anything but easy.
Don't associate with them.
That girl looks very pretty.
You've been properly led up the garden path.
As for me, I don't want to go out.
This book is not only interesting but also instructive.
You must do it yourself.
What is that?
About how long will it take?
I have got to go now.
Could you let it out?
Don't worry about it!
I haven't heard a word from him as yet.
He was given a book by me.
