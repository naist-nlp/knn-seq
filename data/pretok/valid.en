This is the only possible time for doing that .
I met him once .
When did you see him ?
I had hoped to meet you there .
That is his house .
I must go some day or other .
The rumor turned out to be false .
Tell me about it .
I don &apos;t quite understand what he says .
It was very nice seeing you again .
It sounds pretty good .
What are you getting at ?
I am quite in the dark as to what she is going to do .
She left home just now .
He is particularly kind to her .
Do it quickly .
She felt as if she had seen a ghost .
I &apos;d rather you stayed at home .
I found the book easy .
There &apos;s something I need to talk with you about .
Something is the matter with him today .
I managed to make him understand it .
That is her house .
He went home with a heavy heart .
I don &apos;t want to go alone .
What I want to say is this .
Those are our books .
Where is it possible for you to see me ?
Get to the point !
I &apos;m glad to meet you , too .
You should have nothing to complain about .
Don &apos;t look at her enviously .
Let me have a try at it .
It is me that is wrong .
I &apos;m at a loss for what to say .
He told her and she smiled .
This is anything but easy .
Don &apos;t associate with them .
That girl looks very pretty .
You &apos;ve been properly led up the garden path .
As for me , I don &apos;t want to go out .
This book is not only interesting but also instructive .
You must do it yourself .
What is that ?
About how long will it take ?
I have got to go now .
Could you let it out ?
Don &apos;t worry about it !
I haven &apos;t heard a word from him as yet .
He was given a book by me .
