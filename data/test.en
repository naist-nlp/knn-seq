Leave me alone , please .
She must have told a lie .
Which book is better ?
What are you doing that for ?
If he comes , so much the better .
To see you is always a great pleasure .
I have nothing to do today .
Can we have a talk ?
That is the house where I was born .
Must I do it now ?
This is her book .
Don &apos;t be so worked up over this thing . It will all blow over before you know it .
You can go if you want to .
Is it yours ?
When did you see her ?
Where are you headed for ?
Do you mean what you say ?
I want to get the book back from her .
You ought not to have said a thing like that to him .
Would you please stop talking ?
Those books are mine .
Everybody was thrilled by his story .
I am a Japanese .
How long will it take ?
Anyone can do that .
What would you like to do ?
I ought to go there , but I won &apos;t .
Do whatever you want to do .
Am I making myself clear ?
It is always the case with him .
I don &apos;t quite know .
It was here that I saw her .
He did nothing out of the way .
I &apos;ll come to your house later .
It &apos;s very kind of you to say so .
Don &apos;t leave here until you have done it .
He asked me what was the matter with me .
You did an excellent job .
Let him have his say .
He often calls her names .
Life is not all fun .
He paid his dues for what he is now .
The sun has not risen yet .
This book is yours .
I am no match for him .
Now , boys. he said .
If you flatter him , he &apos;ll do anything .
He made me out to be a liar .
He &apos;s not like us .
Let &apos;s go !
